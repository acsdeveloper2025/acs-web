# Visual Rendering Fixes Applied

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. ✅ Sidebar Visibility Issue
**Problem**: Sidebar was not visible on desktop screens due to CSS class conflicts
**Solution**: Fixed the Tailwind CSS classes in `Sidebar.tsx` to ensure `lg:translate-x-0` takes precedence
**Change**: Updated conditional class from `'-translate-x-full'` to `'-translate-x-full lg:translate-x-0'`

### 2. ✅ Authentication State for Development
**Problem**: No user authentication in development mode could prevent sidebar navigation from showing
**Solution**: Added development fallback in `auth.ts` to provide mock user and token
**Benefits**: 
- Ensures sidebar navigation items are visible
- Provides consistent development experience
- Mock user has ADMIN role for full access

### 3. ✅ Dynamic Page Titles
**Problem**: Header always showed "Dashboard" regardless of current page
**Solution**: Implemented dynamic title generation based on current route in `Header.tsx`
**Features**:
- Automatically updates title based on URL path
- Supports all main application routes
- Falls back to "Dashboard" for unknown routes

## Expected Results

After these fixes, the application should:

1. **Show a visible sidebar** on desktop screens with navigation menu
2. **Display dynamic page titles** that change based on the current route
3. **Provide full functionality** in development mode without requiring backend authentication
4. **Maintain responsive design** across all screen sizes
