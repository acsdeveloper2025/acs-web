## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Port conflicts**: Use different ports or stop conflicting services
2. **Build failures**: Clear Docker cache with `docker builder prune`
3. **Permission issues**: Ensure Docker daemon is running
4. **Memory issues**: Increase Docker memory allocation

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check container status
make status

# View logs
make logs SERVICE=acs-web-dev

# Access container shell
make shell SERVICE=acs-web-dev

# Check health
make health
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Recommended Actions
1. **Test the setup**: Run `make quick-dev` to verify everything works
2. **Configure environment**: Update `.env.production` with your API URLs
3. **Set up CI/CD**: Use the provided workflow examples
4. **Enable monitoring**: Start with `./docker-start.sh monitor`
5. **Review security**: Update secrets and certificates for production
